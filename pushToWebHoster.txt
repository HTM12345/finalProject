If the html file is called index.html, the web path will just run that file

if there is no file with that name, it will show all the files hosted; both html and python

to push files to the webhoster:
use cd and the file path of the directory ($ cd /home/somedir)
then:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

runs on your local network
